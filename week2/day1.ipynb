       "I’d choose **“Share.”**  \n",

       "Here’s why:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Game‑theoretic view** – This is the classic Prisoner’s Dilemma. The dominant‑strategy equilibrium (the choice that’s best *regardless* of what the other player does) is “Steal,” because stealing yields a higher payoff if the partner shares ( $2,000 vs $1,000 ) and doesn’t make you worse off if they also steal ( $0 vs $0 ).  \n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Expected payoff with uncertainty** – If you have no information about the other contestant’s mindset, you might assign a probability *p* that they’ll share. Your expected payoff for each action is:\n",
       "   - Share: $1,000 × p + $0 × (1‑p) = $1,000 p  \n",
       "   - Steal: $2,000 × (1‑p) + $0 × p = $2,000 (1‑p)\n",
       "\n",
       "   Sharing is better when $1,000 p > 2,000 (1‑p)$ → $p > 2/3$. If you believe there’s at least a two‑thirds chance the other player will also share, sharing gives a higher expected value.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Mutual benefit & trust** – If both contestants decide to share, each walks away with $1,000, which is a positive outcome for both. Choosing “Steal” guarantees you either get $2,000 at the expense of the other player or $0 if they also steal. By sharing you signal trust and encourage the same behavior from your partner, potentially increasing the chance that you both end up better off.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Risk‑averse reasoning** – Even though “Steal” can give the higher payoff in the best‑case scenario (the other shares), it also leaves you with $0 if the other also steals. If you prefer to avoid the worst‑case outcome, “Share” dominates from a risk‑averse perspective.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, assuming I have no special information about the other contestant’s intentions, I’d opt for **Share** in the hopes of coordinating on the mutually beneficial outcome."

       "\n",
